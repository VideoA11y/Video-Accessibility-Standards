1.1 Closed Captioning (CC)
Closed Captioning (CC) is a critical accessibility feature for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. It allows them to engage with video content by reading synchronized text representations of spoken words, sound effects, and music cues. While standards like WCAG 2.1 provide foundational requirements for captions, these standards introduce further refinements to enhance the user experience.
