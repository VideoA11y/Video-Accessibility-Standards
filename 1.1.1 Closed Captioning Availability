1.1.1 Closed Captioning Availability

All video available via traditional media, streaming, or social platforms, regardless of production value, must have accurate, synchronized closed captioning available via a quick mechanism for turning captions on or off.

1.1.1-A

Distributed video content including tv shows, movies, commercials, etc., live or prerecorded, must have accurate and synchronized Closed Captioning with minimal delay to create an equitable viewing experience. While live captions may have a slight delay due to the nature of real-time transcription, platforms should aim to minimize this gap as much as possible.

1.1.1-B

Distributed video content, live or prerecorded, may not use automatically generated captions without human review. Current automatic captioning technologies often fall short of these requirements, particularly for live content or complex dialogue.

1.1.1-C

Platforms hosting user-generated content, live or prerecorded, must have automatically generated captions with demonstrably beneficial accuracy. Contributors should not be allowed to disable CC generation. This is particularly relevant to social media where a significant portion of content is produced by users.

1.1.1-D

User-generated content platforms must provide tools that allow creators to edit, replace, improve, and rate the accuracy of generated captions. This allows content creators to achieve high standards of accessibility by improving caption accuracy.

1.1.1-E

Caption files should be downloadable for reuse across other platforms ensuring easy access to high-quality captions for content creators and users.

1.1.1-F

Platforms must offer intuitive controls to enable or disable captions from multiple interfaces, such as the video player itself, settings menus, and user-definable remote control interactions where applicable.
