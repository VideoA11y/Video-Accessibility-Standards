1.1.1 Closed Captioning Availability

All video available via traditional media, streaming, or social platforms, regardless of production value, must have accurate, synchronized closed captioning available via a quick mechanism for turning captions on or off. 

1.1.1-A

Distributed video content including tv shows, movies, commercials, etc., live or prerecorded, must have accurate and synchronized Closed Captioning. Pre-recorded CC synchronization should match the audio of the asset without delay when technically feasible. Delays are common with live, transcribed CC, but should be minimized as much as possible.

1.1.1-B

Distributed video content, live or prerecorded, may not use automatically-generated captions until the technology is proven reliable and accurate.

1.1.1-C

Platforms that support user-produced video content, live or prerecorded, must have automatically generated captions with demonstrably beneficial accuracy. These platforms must generate CC by default. Contributors may not disable CC.

1.1.1-D

Platforms that support user-produced video content, live or prerecorded, must allow uploaders to edit, replace, improve, and rate the accuracy of generated captions.

1.1.1-E

Closed captioning created via platform-specific tools, must be available for download and reuse elsewhere.

1.1.1-F

All platforms must have the ability to turn Closed Captioning on or off from within the settings interface, the video player interface, and a user-definable remote interaction.
