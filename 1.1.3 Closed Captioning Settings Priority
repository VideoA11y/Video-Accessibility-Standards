1.1.3 Closed Captioning Settings Priority
When using a new device, platforms, apps, and websites with account-based Closed Captioning styles and synchronized settings must use the system-level settings and styles until overridden by the user on each new device.

1.1.3-A
Platforms must use the default, system-level Closed Captioning settings and styles if a user has not overridden them or signs out of their platform account. The currently selected, platform-based, Closed Captioning state (on or off) must be respected until the user changes it. The default, system-level style must render captions without customizations as set by the CC content providers until the user changes them.

1.1.3-B
Platforms, apps, and websites with account-based synchronizations must show styles created on other devices, allow selection of synchronized styles, and offer saving customized styles as new, synchronized styles.

1.1.3-C
Once overridden, the Closed Captioning style must remain persistent on relaunch, restart, or reboot of the platform, app, or website unless the user has changed the system-level style or signed out of their account. Developers must not use cookies as the only storage method for Closed Captioning style data; cookies are not persistent.

1.1.3-D
Apps and websites must detect system-level Closed Captioning style changes and use the updated system-level style until overridden by the user within the app or website. Apps and websites must also use the system-level Closed Captioning style if a user signs out of their account.
