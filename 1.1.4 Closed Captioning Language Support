1.1.4 Closed Captioning Language Support
Closed Captioning must properly display the text of any supported language to create a more inclusive experience for all cultures.

1.1.4-A
All Closed Captioning must have English and Spanish content in the United States. These guidelines will require other languages as they move beyond the United States and receive wider adoption.

1.1.4-B
Closed Captioning fonts must include the special characters required for proper display of supported languages. This may necessitate the use of alternate fonts for other languages.

1.1.4-C
Languages that are read right-to-left, bottom-to-top, etc. must have compatible Closed Captioning presentation styles to accommodate the inverse animations. This includes, but is not limited to, pop-on, roll-up, and paint-on. Any additional presentation styles must accommodate alternative language directions as well should not violate accessibility guidelines surrounding animations found in section 2.1.1.
