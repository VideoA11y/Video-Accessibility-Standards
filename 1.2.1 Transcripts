1.2.1 Transcripts
Transcripts provide a detailed, static text version of video or audio content, allowing users to process information at their own pace. This feature is especially useful for people who may struggle with the speed or synchronization of real-time captions or for those who use assistive technologies like screen readers or braille devices.

1.2.1-A
Transcripts must be available in English and Spanish for the United States. International platforms must also include the local language, along with any languages with a minimum of 10% usage, based on local census results.

1.2.1-B
For audio-only content (e.g., podcasts), transcripts must be easily accessible through the player interface, a dedicated webpage, or an app. This ensures users can interact with audio content in a text-based format. Synchronization is not required, but is beneficial if transcripts are included in the player interface. External transcripts should support braille devices.

1.2.1-C
For audio-visual content, Closed Captioning must be available in the player interface, while transcripts must be easily accessible through the player interface, a dedicated webpage, or an app. This ensures users can interact with audio content in a text-based format. Transcript synchronization is not required, but is beneficial if transcripts are included in the player.

1.2.1-D
Distributed, pre-recorded video content may not use automatically generated captions without human review. Transcripts must be effective for users. Current automatic transcription technologies often fall short of these requirements, particularly for live or complex dialogue.

1.2.1-E
Platforms hosting pre-recorded, user-generated content must have automatically generated transcriptions with demonstrably beneficial accuracy. Contributors should not be allowed to disable transcription generation.

1.2.1-F
User-generated content platforms must provide tools that allow creators to edit, replace, improve, and rate the accuracy of generated transcripts. This allows content creators to achieve high standards of accessibility by improving caption accuracy.

1.2.1-G
Transcript files should be downloadable for reuse across other platforms ensuring easy access to high-quality captions for content creators and users.

1.2.1-H
Transcripts should be designed to work seamlessly with screen readers. This includes proper markup and formatting to ensure that all content is accessible.

1.2.1-I
Transcripts should support braille devices, ensuring that users who rely on these technologies can read the text accurately.
