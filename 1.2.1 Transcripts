1.2.1 Transcripts
Whether the cadence of Closed Captioning is too fast or a user has difficulty with reading comprehension, transcripts offer users more control over the pace at which they consume multimedia content.

1.2.1-A
All transcripts must have English and Spanish content in the United States. These guidelines will require other languages when they move beyond the United States and receive wider adoption.

1.2.1-B
Content with audio and no video (i.e. podcasts) must have transcripts available from the player interface, a website, an app, or another universally accessible solution. Any of these options will satisfy this requirement. Synchronization is not required, but beneficial if included in the player interface. Transcripts not included in the player should support braille devices.

1.2.1-C
Content with audio and video must have Closed Captioning and transcripts available from the player interface, a website, an app, or another universally accessible solution. Any of these options will satisfy this requirement. Synchronization is not required, but beneficial if included in the player interface. Transcripts not included in the player should support braille devices.

1.2.1-D
Distributed, prerecorded content must have accurate, curated transcripts and may not use automatically generated transcripts until the technology is proven reliable and accurate.

1.2.1-E
Platforms that support user-produced prerecorded content must have automatically generated transcripts with demonstrably beneficial accuracy and allow uploaders to edit, replace, improve, and rate the accuracy of the generated transcripts.
