2.1.1 Animations
Animations, while visually appealing, can cause confusion, trigger seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy, or cause discomfort for those with other cognitive or visual conditions. Regardless of platform-specific animation support, all platforms, apps, or websites must adhere to these requirements.

2.1.1-A
Flashing, blinking, or pulsing animations are prohibited. This goes beyond WCAG 2.1 2.3.1, which restricts flashing content that exceeds three flashes per second. It is simply best to avoid animations of this type.

2.1.1-B
Users must have the option to turn off all animations, following WCAG 2.1 2.2.2, which mandates that users can pause, stop, or hide any moving content.

2.1.1-C
Animations should never be forced on users during onboarding. All animations must be opt-in and easily accessible through the settings interface.

2.1.1-D
Platforms providing animation control APIs require apps and websites to adjust animations to comply with user preferences. This encourages platform-wide consistency for animation handling.

2.1.1-E
For platforms without animation control APIs, apps and websites must have animations off by default and allow users to opt-in. This approach reduces the likelihood of exposing users to undesired visual stimuli.
