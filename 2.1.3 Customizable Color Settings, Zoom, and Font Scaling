2.1.3 Customizable Color Settings, Zoom, and Font Scaling
Giving users control over the visual presentation of content through customizable settings like high contrast or user-definable colors, zoom, and font scaling enhances accessibility for individuals with various visual needs.

2.1.3-A
If a platform, app, or website does not meet the minimum contrast ratios found in 2.1.2,  they must include a high-contrast option in their accessibility settings to meet those requirements.

2.1.3-B
If a platform, app, or website offers user-customizable foreground/background colors and the user has high contrast options enabled in settings, the interface must only show high contrast color ratios as defined in 2.1.2 to maintain accessibility, particularly for users with low vision and color blindness.

2.1.3-C
When platforms, apps, and websites allow users different color choices for large vs. small text, these options must adhere to the contrasts specified in 2.1.2. If a color choice applies to both sizes, it must meet the 7:1 ratio requirement for small text.

2.1.3-D
Offering zoom and font scaling options does not exempt a platform, app, or website from adhering to the minimum font size and contrast requirements outlined in 2.1.2. Zoom functions are supplementary, not a substitute for accessibility.

2.1.3-E
Conversely, zoom is a suggestion, not a requirement. Compliance with minimum font sizes is a good baseline that can be further enhanced with zoom features.

2.1.3-F
If a platform has user settings for zoom, font scaling, and contrast at a system level, apps or websites must respect those settings. They may not disable any zoom, font scaling, or contrast features present on any platform.

2.1.3-G
As with other synchronized user settings, platforms, apps, and websites may not override the system-level default or user-selected zoom, font scaling, or contrast settings unless changed by the user within the interface settings. Apps and websites may not push their settings to the system-level settings at any time.
