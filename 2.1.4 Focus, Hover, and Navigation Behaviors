2.1.4 Focus, Hover, and Navigation Behaviors
All platforms, apps, and websites must provide a high-contrast visual indicator to represent the currently-focused or hovered object when using a remote, keyboard/tab navigation, mouse pointer, or other assistive technology and respect accessible navigation behaviors.

2.1.4-A
Since 10-foot platforms use remote buttons for selection and navigation, all 10-foot platforms, apps, and websites must offer a high-contrast (4.5:1 or higher) border for the currently-focused object to improve the accessible experience of using a remote.

2.1.4-B
Platforms, apps, and websites that support mouse, pointer, keyboard, or tab-based navigation and selection interactions must offer a high-contrast (4.5:1 or higher) focus and hover state for all interactable objects like buttons, tiles, links, etc.

2.1.4-C
If a platform, app, or website does not include the required high-contrast visual indicator in their default user experience, they must include an option in their accessibility settings to turn the required indicator on or off.

2.1.4-D
Focusing or hovering an object must not change the context of the interface by hiding or revealing other elements or placing the user’s focus elsewhere. Specifically, a selection interaction must precede all context changes.

2.1.4-E
When using selection interactions on 10-foot platforms, apps, or websites, the interaction must not place the user’s focus elsewhere within the same interface. This is not a standardized pattern on 10-foot platforms and causes user confusion. 

2.1.4-F
Platforms, apps, and websites that use disabled elements (i.e. multi-part settings) must always keep those elements visible and focusable to inform the user of their current state. Disabled elements must receive a different visual state while adhering to the minimum contrast ratios defined in 2.1.2.
