2.3 Secondary Audio Programming
Secondary Audio Programming (SAP), in the United States, currently provides delivery of Audio Descriptions (AD) and Spanish audio for linear TV shows and movies. These guidelines require the separation of AD and SAP into multiple audio layers like the experience available on some streaming services. AD requirements are documented in section 2.3.2 of these guidelines.
