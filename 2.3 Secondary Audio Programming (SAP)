2.3 Secondary Audio Programming (SAP)
Secondary Audio Programming (SAP) is a linear television term referring to additional audio tracks that provide alternative language options or audio descriptions (AD) for visual content. In the US, SAP is frequently used to deliver audio descriptions for visually impaired viewers and Spanish-language audio for linear TV programs. These guidelines require the separation of SAP into multiple audio tracks like the experience available on some streaming services.
