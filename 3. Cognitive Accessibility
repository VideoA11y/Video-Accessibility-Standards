3. Cognitive Accessibility
Cognitive accessibility focuses on reducing the cognitive load required to navigate and use platforms, apps, and websites, making them more inclusive for users with cognitive disabilities, such as ADHD, dyslexia, or memory impairments. Ensuring consistency, clear communication, error prevention, and flexible user controls helps users maintain focus and reduces potential confusion or frustration.
