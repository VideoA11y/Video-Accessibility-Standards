3.1.1 Information, Instructions, and Prompts
If a platform, app, or website communicates information, instructions, or prompts to users, that communication must be clear to all users. 

3.1.1-A
Information, instructions, or prompts must not be presented solely through shape, color, size, visual location, visual orientation, or sound. Using a single presentation indicator makes it impossible to communicate clearly to all users.

3.1.1-B
Text content must not exceed a fifth-grade reading level. It should reduce the number of large words, contractions, and extensive or complex punctuation. It should use active voice instead of passive voice to make sentences shorter, more direct, and easier to understand.

3.1.1-C
Instructions and prompts must be direct to communicate that users are being asked to do something. They must also use general terms (e.g. “enter”) instead of input-specific terms (e.g. “click” or “type”) to avoid confusing people who use assistive technologies with different input methods than what was presented in the instructions.

3.1.1-D
Text content must use a clearly written double-spaced font. This improves user understanding, assists people with dyslexia, and makes text easier to read by helping people mentally separate lines of text.
