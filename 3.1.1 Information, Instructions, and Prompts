3.1.1 Information, Instructions, and Prompts
Clear communication is critical for cognitive accessibility. Users should never need to interpret complex instructions or rely on incomplete information.

3.1.1-A
Information, instructions, or prompts must not be conveyed solely through shape, color, size, visual location, visual orientation, or sound. Using a single presentation indicator makes it impossible to communicate clearly to all users. For example, colorblind users may miss color-coded instructions, and users with hearing impairments may not catch audio cues. This guideline prevents reliance on a single sensory input, aligning with accessibility standards for clear communication, such as WCAG 2.1 1.3.3.

3.1.1-B
When presenting critical information such as task instructions, decision modals, etc., text content should not exceed a seventh-grade reading level. It should also avoid passive voice, complex words, contractions, or excessive punctuation. Simpler content aids comprehension for users with cognitive challenges. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 3.1.5.

3.1.1-C
Instructions and prompts must clearly communicate that users need to take action. They must also use general terms like “select” instead of "click" or "tap." This benefits users with varying input devices and assistive technologies, ensuring that directions are universally understood regardless of how the user interacts with the content.

3.1.1-D
Text content should be presented in a double-spaced format. Double-spacing helps users with dyslexia or low vision to more easily follow along and mentally separate lines of text.
