3.1.2 Controls
Platforms must ensure that controls are easy to use, consistent, and intuitive for all users. Predictable interactions reduce confusion and cognitive strain. Apps and websites must not override platform-provided controls and options.

3.1.2-A
Platform controls should be standardized and consistent across all applications and settings. This ensures that users are not confused by different control schemes or behaviors when switching between apps, promoting a smooth and predictable experience. Consistency in controls aligns with accessibility principles of predictable navigation, as outlined by WCAG 2.1 3.2.3.
