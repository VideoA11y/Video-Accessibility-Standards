3.1.3 Labels
Clear, informative, logical labels provide users with essential context and improve the ease of navigation, especially for those with cognitive disabilities.

3.1.3-A
Interactive elements that perform the same function must be labeled consistently. This reduces cognitive confusion and helps users quickly identify familiar features, following WCAG 2.1 3.2.4.

3.1.3-B
Every screen must have a descriptive, informative title. This helps users understand the purpose of the screen at a glance, aiding navigation, especially for those with cognitive impairments. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 2.4.2, which emphasizes the importance of page titles.

3.1.3-C
Section headings must provide structure that aids comprehension and gives users an overview of the screen, reducing cognitive load and helping with navigation, as recommended in WCAG 2.1 2.4.10.

3.1.3-D
Forms must be labeled with clear, descriptive instructions. This ensures that users can easily understand the purpose of each field, improving form accessibility and usability.

3.1.3-E
Link and button text must clearly communicate the purpose of the link itself. Ambiguous or vague link text, such as “click here” or “more,” should be avoided, as it can cause confusion, especially for users relying on screen readers or those with memory or cognitive impairments. This supports WCAG 2.1 2.4.4.
