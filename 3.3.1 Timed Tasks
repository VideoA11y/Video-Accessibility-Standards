3.3.1 Timed Tasks
If a user interface automatically dismisses a visual element after a certain amount of time (toast, modal, etc.), the platform, app, or website must include an accessible setting that allows the user to customize the timeouts for all elements dependent on the interaction.  

3.3.1-A
Toasts, banners, error alerts, etc. that don’t require user interaction before automatic dismissal must have a user-customizable setting to adjust the timeout value ranging from 5 to 120 seconds. The required values for this option are 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120. Offering the user more options is encouraged.

3.3.1-B
Captive elements, modals, interactable toasts, etc. must not enable automatic dismissal by default. These elements must have a user-customizable setting to adjust the timeout value ranging from Off to 120 seconds. Off represents the default, required experience for these elements. Selecting another required value – 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, or 120 – enables the timeout for these elements.

3.3.1-C
When the user has Screen Reader or Text-to-Speech enabled, the user-customizable timeout value applies after the synthetic voice speaks the content of the visual element. (Add reference to SR and TTS guidelines)

3.3.1-D
Regardless of the selected timeout value, Screen Reader and Text-to-Speech platforms must have a user-customizable button or pattern that repeats the spoken content of all dismissable elements. (Add reference to SR and TTS guidelines)
