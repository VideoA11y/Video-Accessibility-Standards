3.3.1 Timed Tasks
Timed visual elements, such as toasts or modals, must be user-friendly and customizable. Platforms, apps, and websites must provide users with the ability to adjust or disable timeouts, ensuring they can interact with these elements without feeling rushed. This is especially important for users with cognitive or motor disabilities, allowing them to process and respond to information at their own pace.

3.3.1-A
Toasts, banners, and error alerts that auto-dismiss after a set time must include a customizable timeout feature. Users should be able to adjust timeouts from 5 to 120 seconds to accommodate their needs, aligning with WCAG 2.1 2.2.1, which emphasizes user control over time limits.

3.3.1-B
Captive elements such as modals, interactive toasts, etc. must not auto-dismiss by default. Users must be able to enable, disable, or adjust the timeout.

3.3.1-C
For users using screen readers or text-to-speech, the customizable timeout should begin after the synthetic voice finishes the script content. If no such logical mechanism is available on a platform, develop one or lobby the platform to change.

3.3.1-D
Regardless of the user-defined timeout value, screen reader and text-to-speech platforms, apps, and websites must have a user-definable button or interaction that repeats the spoken content of all dismissable elements. This is commonly solved by including a “press up to repeat” text-to-speech instruction.
