3.4.2 Error Resolution
Effective error resolution mechanisms are essential to help users understand and correct mistakes that occur during interactions. Providing clear instructions and preserving data helps reduce user frustration, particularly for those with cognitive disabilities.

3.4.2-A
When input errors are detected, the system must provide clear, concise suggestions on how to correct the error. Error messages should be easy to understand, following WCAG 2.1 3.3.1, which focuses on providing identifiable and actionable error messages.

3.4.2-B
When input errors occur, any correctly entered data must be preserved to prevent users from needing to re-enter it. This reduces cognitive load and ensures that user data remains intact despite errors.

3.4.2-C
A summary of all errors must be displayed at the top of the form, while individual error messages should be shown next to the respective fields in error. This two-tiered approach ensures that users can easily locate and address each error, in line with WCAG 2.1 3.3.3.

3.4.2-D
Users should not have to memorize error-handling instructions. Instead, the system must keep instructions visible while the user is fixing the problem.

3.4.2-E
Form fields must indicate successful input entry, providing immediate feedback to users that their input has been accepted. Clearing the error after the user has fixed the problem must show visual confirmation of the change, as well as text-to-speech confirmation of the resolution.
