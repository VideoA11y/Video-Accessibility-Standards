4.1.1 Drag and Drop
Providing alternatives to drag-and-drop interactions is crucial for users with motor disabilities or those using assistive technologies that do not accommodate drag-and-drop functionality.

4.1.1-A
Platforms, apps, and websites should avoid drag-and-drop interactions when possible. If drag-and-drop is used, alternative interactions that donâ€™t require fine motor control must be available. For example, using a keyboard to select and move an item to its new location is an acceptable alternative. This guideline aligns with WCAG 2.1 2.1.1, which requires keyboard operability for all functions.

4.1.1-B
Drag-and-drop interactions must be fully compatible with assistive technologies designed to replace mouse, pointer, and touch interactions to ensure users with motor disabilities can perform these actions. Specifically, all platforms, apps, or websites must accommodate keyboard and switch device navigation. These assistive technologies utilize the same patterns as connected tv remote interfaces that do not have mouse, pointer, or touch flows.
