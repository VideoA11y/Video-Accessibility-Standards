4.1.2 Press-and-Hold Interactions
While not supported ubiquitously, some connected TV platforms and apps have begun to support press-and-hold interactions. These interactions are difficult for users with limited motor function and other dexterity considerations.

Platforms, apps, and websites must offer alternatives for press-and-hold interactions. Commonly used for rewind, fast forward, and scrubbing interactions in a video player, these press-and-hold patterns can be replaced with other, more accessible options - pressing multiple times to speed up or changing functionality based on focus location.
