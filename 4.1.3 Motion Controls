4.1.3 Motion Controls
If a platform, app, or website utilizes motion-based controls, pointers, or sensors, the interface must offer alternative forms of control and allow these controls to be deactivated. Letting users disable motion controls gives them greater control over their interactions, prevents unintended actions, and accommodates people with motor disabilities.

4.1.3-A
Platforms, apps, and websites must not solely rely on motion controls for the navigation of the user interface. They must offer alternative forms of navigation that are compatible with keyboard, switch devices, and connected tv remotes. This is in line with WCAG 2.1 2.5.4, which requires alternatives to motion-based controls.

4.1.3-B
Platforms that use motion-based controls, gestures, or sensors must offer users the option to disable these features. Fine motor requirements and accidental activations can be problematic for users with motor disabilities.
