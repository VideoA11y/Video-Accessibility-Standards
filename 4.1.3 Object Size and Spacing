4.1.3 Object Size and Spacing
All platforms, apps, or websites that provide mouse, pointer, touch, or remote interactions must present interactable objects with accessible size and space to prevent input errors for users with limited fine motor skills and cognitive overload for users of all abilities.

4.1.3-A
Platforms, apps, and websites that utilize mouse, pointer, touch, or remote interactions must use large enough targets to accommodate the average size of a human finger. Translating a physical measurement to a virtual, density-independent pixel size requires a deeper understanding of resolution scaling. See our supplemental information for this guideline for an in-depth explanation. A 10mm touch target roughly translates to a 50×50 dp/px object size when using a 1x scale, baseline density of 160 dots per inch. All interactables must meet or exceed this size unless otherwise required by a specific platform’s human interface guidelines.

4.1.3-B
When using a target size of 50×50 dp/px at 160 dpi, platforms, apps, and websites should consider 25 dp/px at 160 dpi as the minimum spacing between adjacent targets to limit input errors for all users.

4.1.3-C
When technically feasible, all platforms, apps, and websites should consider offering user-customizable layouts, scaling, and spacing for interfaces that include many adjacent objects. Interactable grids, lists, and swimlanes are all perfect examples of interfaces that benefit from these considerations.
