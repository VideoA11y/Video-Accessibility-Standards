4.2.1 Account Authentication Alternatives
If a platform, app, or website requires account authentication, the user flow must not require username and password entry. Alternative methods such as SMS or email verification, second device authentication, or QR codes must be available to accommodate users with motor disabilities or those using assistive technologies.

4.2.1-A
Platforms, apps, and websites must not solely rely on username and password authentication. They must provide at least one alternative, accessible authentication method, as outlined in Section 3.3.2.

4.2.1-B
Platforms, apps, and websites must not use cognitive function tests like CAPTCHAs for authentication, as outlined in Section 3.3.2, as many of these tests require drag-and-drop controls and do not accommodate people with motor disabilities.
