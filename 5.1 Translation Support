5.1 Translation Support
All video platform content must be universally accessible to as many users as possible. English is the primary spoken language in the U.S., and most video content is produced in English. In 2019, 13.52% of the U.S. population 5 years and older spoke Spanish at home (United States Census Bureau). English and Spanish are used by a significant number of users and need to be options on video platforms. Support for languages beyond English and Spanish is also highly encouraged.
