5.2.1 Reading Direction Changes
When a platform, app, or website supports languages of multiple reading directions, it must ensure that the directions of individual UI elements are properly displayed.

5.2.1-A
Text alignment, images of text, and meaningfully-ordered images must be changed to match the written direction. For example, in right-to-left language support, text alignment and images of text must be shown in right-left direction.

5.2.1-B
Images, numbers, logos, and universal symbols are not affected by changes in written direction.
