5.2.1 Reading Direction Changes
When supporting multiple languages with different reading directions, the layout and alignment of text and other meaningful content must adjust accordingly.

5.2.1-A
Text alignment, images of text, and meaningfully-ordered images must follow the correct reading direction. For example, in languages like Arabic or Hebrew, text and images of text must be aligned right-to-left.

5.2.1-B
Universal symbols, logos, numbers, and images not tied to a specific language must remain unaffected by changes in reading direction. These elements should retain their original orientation to avoid confusion.

5.2.1-C
Platforms, apps, and websites that support languages with different reading directions, the navigation and user flow of the app should be updated to accommodate the language. For example, a right-to-left language should have a right-aligned menu with the content entry flow from the right.
