6.1.1 Settings Selections
If a platform, app, or website allows the user to customize accessibility features in its settings, those selections must persist across sessions. This allows users to retain their preferences without needing to reset them after closing an app or restarting a platform.

6.1.1-A
All user-selected settings must persist when a platform, app, or website is closed, put into sleep mode, powered off, or updated. User preferences must be saved within a user account since cookies are not permanent.
