6.2.2 Text and Text Area Customizations
All platforms, apps, and websites must allow users to customize the presentation of text to meet their needs.

6.2.2-A
Visual blocks of text must allow users to select a font color and background color. Long blocks of text can be easier to read when users can adjust the colors to their preferences.

6.2.2-B
A text block must allow users to set a maximum width of 80 characters of glyphs. Note: The exception is 40 characters if the font is CJK.

6.2.2-C
Text boxes must allow users to ensure text is non-justified. Users should be allowed to control the text position to their preferences. 

6.2.2-D
Text boxes must allow users to set line spacing greater than or equal to 1.5 times the point size within a given paragraph. The typical single spacing is considered 1.0 times the point size and may be too small for certain users.

6.2.2-E
Text boxes must allow users to set paragraph spacing to greater than or equal to 1.5 times the point size within a given paragraph.

6.2.2-F
Text boxes must allow users to resize text without assistive technology, up to 200 percent, in such a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a complete line of text on a window set to “full-screen”.

6.2.2-G
Text boxes must allow users to set text to underlined. This keeps letters in a line for people with dyslexia who may perceive text as floating.
