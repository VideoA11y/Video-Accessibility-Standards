6.2.3 Disable Animations
All platforms, apps, and websites must allow users to deactivate animated content.

6.2.3-A
Users must have control over animated, blinking, moving, scrolling, and other automatically updating information as stated in section 2.1.1. Giving certain users control over moving content makes it easier for them to interact with the content of a page. Note: Presentations of data that can be updated in real time may not need to be controls.
