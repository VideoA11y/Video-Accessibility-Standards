6.3.1 Directional Navigation
Navigation should happen in a predictable, consistent manner and work seamlessly with assistive technologies like keyboards or screen readers to reduce cognitive load for users.

6.3.1-A
Navigation must flow in a predictable top-left to bottom-right direction to reduce cognitive load and integrate smoothly with assistive technologies like keyboards and screen readers. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 2.4.3, which specifies a logical focus order for navigation.

6.3.1-B
As discussed in section 5.2, there are certain languages where the flow would be more accommodating by using a top-right to bottom left user flow. When supporting those languages, this navigation pattern should be considered.
