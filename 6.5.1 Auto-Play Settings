6.5.1 Auto-Play Settings
Disabling auto-play content, such as videos or audio, reduces cognitive load and gives users the ability to pause, stop, or mute automatically playing media.

6.5.1-A
Auto-play features must be disabled by default, allowing users to opt-in if desired. This helps prevent cognitive overload and ensures a smoother experience for those who need more time to process content.

6.5.1-B
Auto-play content must provide clear controls for stopping, pausing, muting, or adjusting the volume, aligning with WCAG 2.1 2.2.2.
