# Video-Accessibility-Standards
As accessibility for web and mobile platforms has evolved, it became clear to the creators of these video accessibility standards that a similar focus was needed for connected TV, streaming services, and other mediums that offer rich, multi-sensory experiences through video and sound. Whether it’s movies, TV shows, live broadcasts, or pre-recorded content, these guidelines are designed to ensure an accessible experience for people of all abilities—encompassing those with hearing, vision, cognitive, motor, and other disabilities, as well as diverse cultural backgrounds.

Our goal is to encourage widespread adoption of these open guidelines, making video content more inclusive for everyone.

These standards are the result of years of experience in the Linear TV, Connected TV, and Streaming video spaces. We’ve drawn inspiration from respected sources like WCAG, Section 508, the ADA, CEA 708-E (paid content), and the EAS, merging these insights into a comprehensive, modern, and open-source framework for video accessibility compliance. As the entertainment industry has grown beyond the original scope of older FCC regulations, it’s time for a fresh approach—one that elevates accessibility standards to meet the demands of today’s digital landscape.

Our standards are open, evolving, and continuously improved by industry experts. There are no strict versions or formal requirements, just practical guidelines designed to help you enhance the accessibility of your video content, whether you’re a developer working on a new app or part of an established organization. By following these standards, you’ll ensure a more equitable and enjoyable experience for every viewer.

This is a living document, constantly refined with input from experts across the industry. We welcome your collaboration—whether it’s through our Slack community or by submitting pull requests on GitHub. Join us in shaping the future of accessible video content.

These standards were originally conceived by Joshua Carr and further developed with input from Jaidynn Fohr, Liz Wong, and Rachel Lewis, who contributed their expertise and vision to the project.
